Things to do:

- Getting the app to consume some of the data
- Isolating only the countries that have data to be clickable so that there is always data to feed from
- Making the 5 countries more clear on the map, different color, marker etc
- Would be nice to have hover on each of the countries and it shows you the country name instead of how it is currently
