## This uses `yarn`, it's better than `npm`. Believe me.

**[Follow these instructions to install `yarn`.](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)** (It still uses `npm` internally.)

_Don't want to follow the installation instructions?_

Just run this `npm install --global yarn`â€”there are [some caveats](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#alternatives-tab) though.

## Don't like all that "merging" business?

Here's what you need to run:

```
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

This makes sure there aren't a lot of merge commits.
